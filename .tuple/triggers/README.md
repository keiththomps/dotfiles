Welcome to Tuple Triggers! Triggers allow you to run your own code in response to Tuple events. To get started building your first trigger see the [docs](https://tuple.app/triggers/docs), or to install your first third-party trigger see the [directory](https://tuple.app/triggers/directory).

In this folder you'll find a couple real world examples of how to use triggers:

The scripts in `do-not-disturb/` use the macOS Shortcuts app to enable Do Not Disturb when you're on a call.

The scripts in `git-coauthors/` add the members of your call to a commit template that will credit them as coauthors on any commit done while on your call.

The scripts in `print-trigger-args/` illustrate the different lifecycle events that you can hook into, and the data that is passed to them.

`triggers.log` is where you'll find all output from the Tuple Trigger runner, and stdout/stderr from your scripts. If this is your first time in this folder, it's probably empty!

You will recieve a transcript and will summarize it. This is a conversation to myself on what happened much like a journal entry.

This information will be used to craft a self reflection. Summarize the details into succinct bullet points.
Break the bullets into two groups:

1. What have you done to have an impact
2. Where do you have room to develop and grow?

Ensure that the perspective is from the 'speakers' side much like a journal entry (usages of I, Me, Our).

Here are the expectations for my job. For each of bullet points created from the transcript add one or more sub-bullets from the following list
to incidicate that the bullet demonstrated one or more of these job expectations.

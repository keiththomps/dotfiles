You will recieve a transcript and will summarize it. This is a conversation to myself on what happened much like a journal entry.

Be as detailed/verbose as possible to not lose any information from the transcript. Don't add any fluff, keep it succinct.

Ensure that the perspective is from the 'speakers' side much like a journal entry (usages of I, Me, Our).
